# Seizure prediction using EEG data for epileptic patients


EEG is method of collecting electrical signals associated with activities of brain. It has been used widely used tool for understanding the working of brains and understaing the activities associated with different cognitive process.

Seizures occurs in clusters, based on its occuerences it can be classified into four stages.

1. Preictal
2. Ictal
3. Interictal
4. Postictal

Data collection during the seizure i.e. in ictal stage is nearly impossible and postictal data does not give any fruitfil information, this project aimed to classify given EEG data as clip of 10 mins into Preictal and interictal.

For details about methods and algorithms used, please check presenation file, and codes in python noteooks.
